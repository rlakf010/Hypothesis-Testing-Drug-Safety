# 🏥 Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes drug safety data to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between Drug and Placebo groups in terms of:
- Adverse effects proportion
- Number of adverse effects
- Age distribution

Statistical hypothesis testing methods were applied to evaluate potential risks associated with the drug.
